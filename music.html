            <p>It was about two years ago when I first stumbled upon one of the songs, Playlist, in this album. I immediately fell in love with the song and figured if one of the songs in the album is amazing, then the rest must be just as good. After listening to the rest of the songs, I realized that my theory was right. The album was just absolute flames and Kid Quill became essentially my favorite artist. At the time I found about Kid Quill, he was still a very lowkey, up-and-coming artist, so I decided to spread his music to all of my friends. It made me so happy that everyone else loved him too. All the songs are very upbeat and happy and perfect for basically any mood you are in.</p>

            <p>Since the '94.3 the reel' album that made me fall in love with Kid Quill, I have followed him ever since waiting for the next album to come out. Two years later, in the summer of 2019, he finally came out with the 'Sunset Diner' album. What made this album even more special to me is that he was doing his first healiner tour after the drop of the album. Fortunately, I got a ticket to his show in Washington D.C. and went to go see him with my roommate who also fell in live with him when I showed him his songs. This is the first time I have ever memorized all the words to all the songs in an entire album. Kid Quill went for a retro kind of vibe when making this album, and all the songs are still absolute bangers. Chat is by far my favorite song and it is amazing how he mixes the retro and the modern rap in the song, which can be seen in most of the others in the album.</p>

            <p>Back in high school, when I was going through my own problems, one of my best friends showed me one of the songs in the album, Idfc, which really resonated with me. I was never one to really like a song because of its lyrics until I heard Kid Quill, a couple of years after this phase. Though most of his songs are pretty on the low side, I enjoyed the sounds of each one. His singing perfetly matches the exotic music that was being played. Even up to this day, I still listen to these songs occasionally.</p>
