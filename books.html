            <h3>It's Kind of a Funny Story</h3>
            <p>Like many ambitious New York City teenagers, Craig Gilner sees entry into Manhattan’s Executive Pre-Professional High School as the ticket to his future. Determined to succeed at life—which means getting into the right high school to get into the right college to get the right job—Craig studies night and day to ace the entrance exam, and does.  That’s when things start to get crazy.At his new school, Craig realizes that he isn't brilliant compared to the other kids; he’s just average, and maybe not even that. He soon sees his once-perfect future crumbling away. The stress becomes unbearable and Craig stops eating and sleeping—until, one night, he nearly kills himself.Craig’s suicidal episode gets him checked into a mental hospital, where his new neighbors include a transsexual sex addict, a girl who has scarred her own face with scissors, and the self-elected President Armelio.  There, isolated from the crushing pressures of school and friends, Craig is finally able to confront the sources of his anxiety.</p>
            <p>As someone who does not enjoy reading, this was one of the first books I ever enjoyed reading. I read this book during my high school years when I was going through tough times. The story it told kept me yearning to read more and find out what happens next. Craig was a somewhat relatable character to me back then, which made me love the book even more, and also I'm just a sucker for lover stories.</p>

            <h4>The Road</h4>
            <p>A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.</p>
            <p>I came across this book during my late high school days where I had to read it for my enlgish class. When I first saw it, I thought it was just going to be another boring, long read but I was proven wrong. The vivid descriptions of the book made me paint pictures in my head of what exactly the scenery looked like in every scene. It was almost like imagining an action movie inside my head.</p>
