        <h5>What was the process of learning HTML and CSS like to you?</h5>  
        <h6>The process of learning HTML and CSS is actually super fun. Like any other kid, I hate school and doing work, but when it comes to this it doesn't even feel like school work. It's like a video game and I feel like I am constanly looking for ways to improve my site. When I did one part I would think to myself, "I can definitely make this cooler," and so I did. There is so much more to learn and I can not wait to make even better websites. </h6>

        <h5>What are some roadblocks you encountered and how did you overcome them?</h5>  
        <h6>Some of the roadblocks I encountered mostly occurred when I tried to go above and beyond what we have learned to make my website even better. I had to look up most things which was not too bad but it was very confusing at the same time. I saw a lot of code that I have never seen and had to try my best to make sense out of it. I could have definitely made this even better than it looks now, but that is for another time I guess. </h6>
