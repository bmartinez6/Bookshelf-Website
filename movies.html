            <h2>Avengers: Endgame</h2>
            <p>Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers -- Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner -- must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos -- the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe.</p>
            
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I was a big superhero fan, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe was the first time I saw "real-life" heroes. My dad had all the comics in his office that I was not allowed to touch, but that didn't stop me. I would sneak a book at a time back into my room, and whenever I finished one, I would put it back and take the next one. All the movies that led up to this one were rewatched countless of time and I have been to the premiere of each of the twenty films. This masterpiece was the perfect conclusion to the many years of film making that built up to this spectacular movie. I will never forget the first time I watched this movie and the emotional rollercoaster I went through. It was the first time I have ever "ugly-cried" inside a movie theater, that's how amazing it was.</p>

            <h2>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h2>
            <p>Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that there are many others who share his special, high-flying talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world.</p>
            
            <p>When I heard about this movie coming out, I immediately hated it. First, because I was really excited it was going to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and not part of Sony. Second, because I thought it was going to be with real actors and not animated. Those two reasons led me to hate this movie so much that I vowed to never watch it. One day, I was just very bored and my roommates decided to put the movie on. Of course I was not too happy at first, but then as the movie went on, I started to love. I think what made me enjoy the movie even more than I anticipated was the fact that I thought I would hate it. As a huge Spider-Man fan, I really thought they did an amazing job telling the story of Miles Morales in the most action, dramatic, and fun way possible.</p>

            <h2>Edge of Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>When Earth falls under attack from invincible aliens, no military unit in the world is able to beat them. Maj. William Cage, an officer who has never seen combat, is assigned to a suicide mission. Killed within moments, Cage finds himself thrown into a time loop, in which he relives the same brutal fight -- and his death -- over and over again. However, Cage's fighting skills improve with each encore, bringing him and a comrade ever closer to defeating the aliens.</p>
            
            <p>I first watched this movie during a flight. I noticed that Tom Cruise was in it, so I just gave it a chance, especially since nothing else was good. It was a very slow movie at first, but then I was drawn to it when he was first revived. It was a very original film that gave it a video game-esque feeling that made me so enticed to it. </p>
